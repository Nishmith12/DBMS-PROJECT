## üöÄ Installation
1. **Set Up a Local Server**  
   Install XAMPP/WAMP and start Apache + MySQL services.

2. **Create Database**  
   - Open phpMyAdmin and create a database named `college`.
   - Import the SQL tables using the schema from [Chapter 5](#chapter-5) of the report or run:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE department (
       dept_id VARCHAR(25) PRIMARY KEY,
       dept_name VARCHAR(25),

     );
     -- Repeat for other tables (resource_person, workshop, student, etc.)
     ```

3. **Configure PHP Connection**  
   Update `connect.php` with your MySQL credentials:
   ```php
   <?php
   $HOSTNAME = 'localhost';
   $USERNAME = 'root';
   $PASSWORD = '';
   $DATABASE = 'college';
   $con = mysqli_connect($HOSTNAME, $USERNAME, $PASSWORD, $DATABASE);
   ?>
